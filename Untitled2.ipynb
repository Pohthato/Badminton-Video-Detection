        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The primary player (Track ID 5) was active for the entire video duration (476 frames), covering a total adjusted distance of approximately $1490.11$ pixels and maintaining an average adjusted speed of $93.90$ pixels/frame. These adjusted metrics provide a normalized view of movement across the court by accounting for perspective.\n",
        "*   Visual analysis of the player's trajectory and activity heatmap revealed concentrated movement primarily within the lower-left quadrant of the court, indicating this area as a significant \"hotspot\" of activity.\n",
        "*   The player's movement appeared fluid and consistent, suggesting successful tracking and an absence of apparent unusual patterns or anomalies in their play.\n",
        "*   The analysis demonstrated the ability to quantify player movement, identify key areas of activity, and infer physical exertion patterns after basic perspective adjustment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Improve Accuracy with Full Camera Calibration:** To obtain truly accurate distances and speeds in real-world units (e.g., meters) and correct for lens distortion, implement a proper camera calibration process using a known pattern.\n",
        "*   **Enhance Tactical Insights with Shuttlecock Tracking:** Develop or fine-tune a robust shuttlecock tracking mechanism, possibly through custom YOLO training or specialized tracking algorithms, to enable comprehensive analysis of rallies, shot placement, and player-shuttlecock interactions.\n",
        "*   **LLM for Feedback Generation:** The current local `gpt2` model proved inadequate for generating high-quality, relevant, and structured coaching feedback. For effective feedback generation, integrating a more advanced and capable LLM (e.g., a larger-scale GPT model via API, or Google Gemini) would be necessary. Such models are better equipped to understand complex instructions, synthesize qualitative and quantitative data, and produce coherent, actionable, and encouraging text in a specified persona."

        "\n",
        "*   The primary player (Track ID 5) was active for the entire video duration (476 frames), covering a total adjusted distance of approximately $1490.11$ pixels and maintaining an average adjusted speed of $93.90$ pixels/frame. These adjusted metrics provide a normalized view of movement across the court by accounting for perspective.\n",
        "*   Visual analysis of the player's trajectory and activity heatmap revealed concentrated movement primarily within the lower-left quadrant of the court, indicating this area as a significant \"hotspot\" of activity.\n",
        "*   The player's movement appeared fluid and consistent, suggesting successful tracking and an absence of apparent unusual patterns or anomalies in their play.\n",
        "*   The analysis demonstrated the ability to quantify player movement, identify key areas of activity, and infer physical exertion patterns after basic perspective adjustment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Improve Accuracy with Full Camera Calibration:** To obtain truly accurate distances and speeds in real-world units (e.g., meters) and correct for lens distortion, implement a proper camera calibration process using a known pattern.\n",
        "*   **Enhance Tactical Insights with Shuttlecock Tracking:** Develop or fine-tune a robust shuttlecock tracking mechanism, possibly through custom YOLO training or specialized tracking algorithms, to enable comprehensive analysis of rallies, shot placement, and player-shuttlecock interactions.\n",
        "*   **LLM for Feedback Generation:** The current local `gpt2` model proved inadequate for generating high-quality, relevant, and structured coaching feedback. For effective feedback generation, integrating a more advanced and capable LLM (e.g., a larger-scale GPT model via API, or Google Gemini) would be necessary. Such models are better equipped to understand complex instructions, synthesize qualitative and quantitative data, and produce coherent, actionable, and encouraging text in a specified persona."

        "The badminton analysis app successfully analyzed player movement. Insights gained include:\n",
        "*   The system can track individual players, calculating their total distance moved and average speed throughout the video.\n",
        "*   Heatmaps reveal areas of high player activity on the court, indicating common positions or movement patterns.\n",
        "*   Player trajectories can be visualized, showing their path over time, which can help understand strategic movements or court coverage.\n",
        "\n",
        "The app's current capabilities are strong in player movement analysis but it was unable to track the shuttlecock in this specific video.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The video `/content/sample_data/VID_20251125_223055.mp4` was successfully loaded and processed, comprising 476 frames with a frame rate of approximately 29.997 frames per second (FPS).\n",
        "*   A YOLOv8n model was successfully integrated to detect 'person' and 'sports ball' classes.\n",
        "*   Player movements were effectively tracked across all frames, resulting in 4614 recorded tracked objects, primarily identifying 'person' instances.\n",
        "*   Movement data for players was successfully analyzed:\n",
        "    *   The `df_tracking` DataFrame contains center coordinates, displacement, and speed for each tracked player.\n",
        "    *   `player_movement_summary` was generated, providing the total distance moved and average speed for each unique player ID.\n",
        "*   Visualizations were successfully generated for player data, including trajectories, a heatmap of activity demonstrating common court positions, and bar plots showing total distance moved and average speed for individual players.\n",
        "*   The 'sports ball' class, intended for shuttlecock detection, did not yield any successful tracks, resulting in an empty `shuttlecock_movement_summary` DataFrame and no related visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current system provides robust player movement analysis, offering valuable insights into player activity, court coverage, and physical exertion. This can be extended to performance analysis, tactical feedback, or fitness monitoring for badminton players.\n",
        "*   To achieve comprehensive badminton analysis, the shuttlecock detection and tracking capabilities need to be significantly improved. This could involve fine-tuning the YOLO model with a custom dataset specifically trained on badminton shuttlecocks or exploring alternative object detection models better suited for small, fast-moving objects in a complex background.\n"

        "# Task\n",
        "To overcome the persistent `NameError`, this critical first step will ensure all necessary data structures are re-initialized and populated. This includes re-loading the video, re-initializing the YOLO model, re-running the full object tracking process to re-create `tracked_objects_data`, then constructing `df_tracking` with calculated center coordinates, and finally re-calculating `fps` and all movement metrics (displacement, speed). This guarantees `df_tracking` and `fps` are fully available for subsequent steps. Once `df_tracking` is confirmed to be populated, filter it to include only 'person' entries. Then, identify the primary player as the one with the longest continuous track duration. Create a new DataFrame, `df_primary_player`, containing only the data for this identified primary player. Introduce a simplified method to account for camera perspective for the `df_primary_player`. Assuming objects higher (smaller y-coordinate) in the frame are further away, apply a weighting factor based on the y-coordinate to the pixel movements. This adjustment aims to normalize distances so that movements in the background are not artificially magnified compared to foreground movements. Recalculate the displacement, total distance moved, and average speed specifically for the `df_primary_player`, now incorporating the basic perspective adjustment. This will provide more realistic movement metrics, accounting for the approximated perspective. Generate new visualizations including trajectory, heatmap, total distance, and average speed. These visualizations will specifically showcase the identified primary player's movement, reflecting the newly calculated perspective-adjusted data. Ensure all plots include clear titles, axis labels, and legends where appropriate. Summarize the improvements made to player identification and perspective adjustment, discussing the enhanced insights gained from focusing on a single player and the limitations without full camera calibration, as well as potential next steps."

        "\n",
        "### Q&A\n",
        "The improvements made to player identification and perspective adjustment involve focusing analysis on a single primary player and applying a simplified perspective weighting. This weighting adjusts movement measurements based on the player's y-coordinate in the frame, aiming to normalize distances where objects appearing higher in the frame are assumed to be further away.\n",
        "\n",
        "Enhanced insights are gained by having more \"realistic\" movement metrics (adjusted distance and speed) for the primary player, providing a clearer understanding of their true physical effort or movement patterns, free from visual distortions caused by perspective. This allows for a more accurate comparison of player activity within different areas of the field.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the current solution has limitations without full camera calibration. The simple y-coordinate-based adjustment is an approximation and does not account for complex camera lens distortions, tilt, pan, or the actual physical dimensions of the playing area. This means the adjustment is still heuristic and may not perfectly reflect real-world distances.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   A `perspective_scaling_factor` of 0.5 was introduced to adjust player movements based on their vertical position in the frame.\n",
        "*   A `perspective_weight` was calculated for each frame, with the weight increasing as the player moved towards the top of the frame (smaller y-coordinate), assuming further distance.\n",
        "*   New metrics were computed for the primary player: `adjusted_distance_moved` (original distance multiplied by `perspective_weight`) and `adjusted_speed` (adjusted distance multiplied by `fps`).\n",
        "*   The primary player's total adjusted distance moved and average adjusted speed were calculated and summarized in `primary_player_adjusted_summary`.\n",
        "*   Four visualizations were generated to analyze the primary player's movement: a trajectory plot, an activity heatmap, and bar plots for total adjusted distance moved and average adjusted speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The applied perspective adjustment provides a more normalized view of player movement, reducing the distortion where movements further from the camera might appear smaller in pixel distance. This allows for a more accurate assessment of a single player's physical output and tactical positioning across different areas of the field.\n",
        "*   To further improve accuracy, the next step should involve implementing a more sophisticated camera calibration technique (e.g., using homography or 3D reconstruction) to project pixel coordinates onto a real-world field coordinate system. This would provide truly ground-truth measurements of distance and speed, enabling more robust sports analytics.\n"

        "\n",
        "### Subtask:\n",
        "Understand the theoretical basis and practical requirements for camera calibration. This will involve defining the input needed for calibration (e.g., chessboard patterns, known court dimensions) and outlining the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reasoning:\n",
        "To accurately convert pixel coordinates to real-world coordinates and correct for image distortions, camera calibration is essential. This subtask focuses on explaining the theoretical foundation and practical inputs required.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Purpose of Camera Calibration**: The primary goal of camera calibration is to determine the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a camera.\n",
        "    *   **Intrinsic parameters** describe how the camera's optical system projects a 3D scene onto a 2D image plane. These include:\n",
        "        *   **Focal lengths (fx, fy)**: The distance between the camera's optical center and the image plane.\n",
        "        *   **Principal point (cx, cy)**: The optical center projected onto the image plane, often assumed to be the center of the image.\n",
        "        *   **Skew coefficient**: Accounts for non-perpendicular sensor axes (often negligible).\n",
        "        *   **Lens distortion coefficients (k1, k2, p1, p2, k3, etc.)**: Account for radial and tangential distortions introduced by the lens.\n",
        "    *   **Extrinsic parameters** describe the camera's position and orientation (rotation and translation) in a fixed 3D world coordinate system.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Why it's needed for this task**: Without calibration, pixel measurements are not directly proportional to real-world distances, especially across different parts of the image due to perspective and lens distortion. For example, a player moving from the foreground to the background would cover fewer pixels for the same real-world distance. Calibration allows us to \"undistort\" the image and then project pixel coordinates onto a planar ground (e.g., the badminton court) to get accurate real-world (x, y) coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Input for Calibration**:\n",
        "    *   **Calibration Patterns**: Typically, images of a known 2D pattern (like a chessboard or a grid of circles) viewed from multiple angles are used. The precise dimensions of these patterns are known, allowing algorithms to detect their corners/centers in the image and use these correspondences to estimate camera parameters.\n",
        "    *   **Known World Coordinates**: For full 3D calibration, we need correspondences between 2D pixel points and their 3D real-world coordinates. If using a planar object like a badminton court, we might use known court dimensions (e.g., court lines, net posts) to establish a homography that maps 2D image points to 2D court coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Process Outline**:\n",
        "    *   **Image Acquisition**: Capture multiple images of the calibration pattern (e.g., a chessboard) from various perspectives, ensuring good coverage of the camera's field of view.\n",
        "    *   **Feature Detection**: Detect characteristic features of the pattern (e.g., chessboard corners) in each image.\n",
        "    *   **Parameter Estimation**: Use algorithms (e.g., Zhang's method implemented in OpenCV) to estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters from the detected 2D-3D point correspondences.\n",
        "    *   **Undistortion and Projection**: Once calibrated, the intrinsic parameters are used to undistort new images, and both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters (or a derived homography) are used to project 2D pixel coordinates to real-world 3D (or 2D on a plane) coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we do not have specific calibration images (like a chessboard) for the provided video, for the purpose of demonstrating the implementation, we will initially **simulate or use placeholder values** for camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters to proceed with the transformation. In a real-world scenario, proper calibration images would be required. Alternatively, if court markings are sufficiently visible and identifiable, we could attempt a homography-based approach to map points to the 2D court plane. However, given the plan, we will stick to a more general calibration setup and placeholder parameters for now."

        "### Q&A\n",
        "*   **Enhanced insights gained from focusing on a single player:** By isolating and analyzing a single player, the analysis provides a clearer understanding of individual movement patterns, activity hotspots, and specific speed and distance metrics, without the noise or complexity of multiple players. The perspective adjustment further refines these metrics, offering a more realistic representation of movement irrespective of their position within the camera frame.\n",
        "*   **Limitations without full camera calibration:** The current perspective adjustment is a simplified heuristic based on y-coordinate. Without full camera calibration, the exact real-world distances and speeds cannot be accurately determined. The adjustment assumes a linear relationship between y-coordinate and distance, which may not precisely reflect the camera's lens distortion or complex field of view, leading to potential inaccuracies in quantifying true movement.\n",
        "*   **Potential next steps:** Future enhancements could involve implementing more sophisticated camera calibration techniques (e.g., using ground control points or known object sizes) to convert pixel distances into real-world units, allowing for more precise and comparable movement analysis across different video sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   A simplified perspective adjustment was successfully implemented using a `perspective_scaling_factor` of 0.5. This factor proportionally increased movement weights for players further up the frame (smaller y-coordinate).\n",
        "*   New movement metrics, `adjusted_distance_moved` and `adjusted_speed`, were calculated by applying the `perspective_weight` to the original `distance_moved` values.\n",
        "*   For the primary player, the `total_adjusted_distance_moved` was `1490.11` pixels, and the `average_adjusted_speed` was `93.90` pixels/frame.\n",
        "*   Four distinct visualizations were generated: the primary player's trajectory, a heatmap of their activity, a bar plot of total adjusted distance moved, and a bar plot of average adjusted speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The simplified perspective adjustment offers improved analysis of player movement by partially compensating for camera angle distortion, providing a more accurate understanding of relative distances and speeds within the frame.\n",
        "*   For more robust and accurate quantification of player movement in real-world units, consider implementing a full camera calibration process using known dimensions or ground control points.\n"

This indicates that the primary player spends most of their time and performs most of their movements within this specific area of the court.\n",

After applying a basic perspective adjustment, this player's `total_adjusted_distance_moved` was approximately **1490.11 pixels**, with an `average_adjusted_speed` of **93.90 pixels/frame**. These adjusted metrics provide a more normalized view of movement across different parts of the court, accounting for the effect of distance from the camera.\n",

After applying a basic perspective adjustment, this player's `total_adjusted_distance_moved` was approximately **1490.11 pixels**, with an `average_adjusted_speed` of **93.90 pixels/frame**. These adjusted metrics provide a more normalized view of movement across different parts of the court, accounting for the effect of distance from the camera.\n",

You have the ability to make an argument for how to perform in basketball, how much you can be, what do these numbers mean. I don't think much about this. It's all about how you handle the situation. What do I do? I make a point of what I'm doing. If I have a really good game and I see a guy coming out of it, I'll do my job. We're going to build a team. But if I get sloppy, then I won't be able to compete. So I just try to figure that out. And I also try not to use a lot of numbers. In this game I had a couple of guys who had pretty good numbers, but I didn't really use them. They were just trying to get better. There was a few situations I was really really bad at when I couldn't do anything. With that said, if you're a great player and you play great basketball you make plays. Because if something stops you from doing that, you'll be in trouble. That's what happens in pro sports. A lot has to happen....I'm not trying the same things as most people do. Look at my game. My first two games, especially defensively I wasn't great. Then I got some really great games. Last year, my first game was against the New Orleans Pelicans. All of these players are in great shape. No one really knows what they can handle. At this point you've got to just go out there and play and make your own way. For me, that's where I come from. When I first came into this team, it was like I played for a good company. One guy said to me about my contract. \"You got a contract.\" I said \"no, no, thank you.\" The guy was saying, \"How much do those guys make?\" I kinda like that.

        "### Q&A\n",
        "The task aimed to summarize the process of integrating a Hugging Face model for feedback generation and provide a concluding statement on the utility and potential of LLM-driven sports analysis, considering local versus API-based models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process demonstrated that while local models can be set up, smaller pre-trained models like `distilgpt2` and `gpt2` are largely ineffective for generating high-quality, relevant, and structured coaching feedback. Their limitations include producing repetitive, incoherent, or irrelevant content, and struggling with context windows and domain-specific synthesis. This highlights a significant challenge in the utility of small, locally run LLMs for complex analytical tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "For effective LLM-driven sports analysis requiring nuanced feedback generation, more advanced and capable LLMs (typically larger, often API-based models like larger GPT models or Google Gemini) are necessary. These models are better equipped to understand complex instructions, synthesize qualitative and quantitative data, and produce coherent, actionable, and encouraging text in a specified persona. The potential of LLM-driven sports analysis is high, but it depends critically on selecting models with sufficient capabilities, making API-based solutions often more practical for sophisticated tasks where local resource constraints or model limitations are a factor.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The installation of `transformers` and `torch` libraries was successful, and `text-generation` pipelines were correctly initialized for `distilgpt2` and `gpt2` models.\n",
        "*   The `distilgpt2` model consistently produced repetitive and incoherent output, failing to generate meaningful coaching feedback despite parameter tuning.\n",
        "*   The `gpt2` model, while larger, also failed to generate relevant or useful feedback, often hallucinating content (e.g., basketball interviews) instead of badminton-specific analysis.\n",
        "*   An `IndexError` occurred with `gpt2` when the combined prompt and generation length exceeded its 1024-token context window.\n",
        "*   Despite iterative prompt engineering and parameter adjustments, both `distilgpt2` and `gpt2` proved inadequate for synthesizing player analysis data into coherent and actionable coaching advice.\n",
        "*   A persistent `SyntaxError: unterminated string literal` was encountered when attempting to output the final summary as markdown, indicating an issue with markdown generation or interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Local, smaller generative models like `distilgpt2` and `gpt2` are insufficient for complex, domain-specific text generation tasks such as providing nuanced coaching feedback.\n",
        "*   To effectively leverage LLMs for sports analysis and feedback, it is imperative to utilize more advanced and capable models, likely larger API-based solutions or more powerful local models if computational resources permit.\n"

        "Qualitative Insights:\n",
        "Trajectory Analysis:\n",
        "  - Overall Path: The player's trajectory shows predominant movement in the lower-left quadrant of the court, with occasional shifts towards the center. Movements are generally confined to this specific area.\n",
        "  - Repetitive Patterns: There are instances of the player returning to a similar central position, suggesting a 'home base' or ready stance. The flow of movement appears fluid and continuous, indicating successful tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "Activity Heatmap Analysis:\n",
        "  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\n",
        "  - Areas of Less Activity: Areas towards the top and right of the frame show considerably lower activity, suggesting these parts of the court are less frequently visited by the player.\n",
        "  - Court Coverage & Efficiency: The concentrated hotspot implies a focused court coverage, potentially indicating efficiency in covering their designated playing area or a strategic limitation to a specific zone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impact of Perspective Adjustment:\n",
        "The perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated. This aids in a more accurate interpretation of the player's performance metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary:\n",
        "Based on these observations, the primary player demonstrates a focused and consistent movement pattern within their active zone. The adjusted metrics provide a robust quantitative foundation for understanding their physical output during the game, complemented by visual insights into their court presence and movement tendencies.\n",

            "Qualitative Insights:\n",
            "Trajectory Analysis:\n",
            "  - Overall Path: The player's trajectory shows predominant movement in the lower-left quadrant of the court, with occasional shifts towards the center. Movements are generally confined to this specific area.\n",
            "  - Repetitive Patterns: There are instances of the player returning to a similar central position, suggesting a 'home base' or ready stance. The flow of movement appears fluid and continuous, indicating successful tracking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Activity Heatmap Analysis:\n",
            "  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\n",
            "  - Areas of Less Activity: Areas towards the top and right of the frame show considerably lower activity, suggesting these parts of the court are less frequently visited by the player.\n",
            "  - Court Coverage & Efficiency: The concentrated hotspot implies a focused court coverage, potentially indicating efficiency in covering their designated playing area or a strategic limitation to a specific zone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Impact of Perspective Adjustment:\n",
            "The perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated. This aids in a more accurate interpretation of the player's performance metrics.\n",
            "\n",
            "Summary:\n",
            "Based on these observations, the primary player demonstrates a focused and consistent movement pattern within their active zone. The adjusted metrics provide a robust quantitative foundation for understanding their physical output during the game, complemented by visual insights into their court presence and movement tendencies.\n",

        "Qualitative Insights:\n",

        "  - Repetitive Patterns: There are instances of the player returning to a similar central position, suggesting a 'home base' or ready stance. The flow of movement appears fluid and continuous, indicating successful tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "Activity Heatmap Analysis:\n",
        "  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\n",
        "  - Areas of Less Activity: Areas towards the top and right of the frame show considerably lower activity, suggesting these parts of the court are less frequently visited by the player.\n",
        "  - Court Coverage & Efficiency: The concentrated hotspot implies a focused court coverage, potentially indicating efficiency in covering their designated playing area or a strategic limitation to a specific zone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impact of Perspective Adjustment:\n",
        "The perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated. This aids in a more accurate interpretation of the player's performance metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary:\n",
        "Based on these observations, the primary player demonstrates a focused and consistent movement pattern within their active zone. The adjusted metrics provide a robust quantitative foundation for understanding their physical output during the game, complemented by visual insights into their court presence and movement tendencies.\n",

            "Qualitative Insights:\n",
            "Trajectory Analysis:\n",
            "  - Overall Path: The player's trajectory shows predominant movement in the lower-left quadrant of the court, with occasional shifts towards the center. Movements are generally confined to this specific area.\n",
            "  - Repetitive Patterns: There are instances of the player returning to a similar central position, suggesting a 'home base' or ready stance. The flow of movement appears fluid and continuous, indicating successful tracking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Activity Heatmap Analysis:\n",
            "  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\n",
            "  - Areas of Less Activity: Areas towards the top and right of the frame show considerably lower activity, suggesting these parts of the court are less frequently visited by the player.\n",
            "  - Court Coverage & Efficiency: The concentrated hotspot implies a focused court coverage, potentially indicating efficiency in covering their designated playing area or a strategic limitation to a specific zone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Impact of Perspective Adjustment:\n",
            "The perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated. This aids in a more accurate interpretation of the player's performance metrics.\n",
            "\n",
            "Summary:\n",
            "Based on these observations, the primary player demonstrates a focused and consistent movement pattern within their active zone. The adjusted metrics provide a robust quantitative foundation for understanding their physical output during the game, complemented by visual insights into their court presence and movement tendencies.\n",

Movements are generally confined to this specific area.\\n  - Repetitive Patterns: There are instances of the player returning to a similar central position, suggesting a 'home base' or ready stance. The flow of movement appears fluid and continuous, indicating successful tracking.\\n\\nActivity Heatmap Analysis:\\n  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\\n  - Areas of Less Activity: Areas towards the top and right of the frame show considerably lower activity, suggesting these parts of the court are less frequently visited by the player.\\n  - Court Coverage & Efficiency: The concentrated hotspot implies a focused court coverage, potentially indicating efficiency in covering their designated playing area or a strategic limitation to a specific zone.\\n\\nImpact of Perspective Adjustment:\\nThe perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated. This aids in a more accurate interpretation of the player's performance metrics.\\n\\nSummary:\\nBased on these observations, the primary player demonstrates a focused and consistent movement pattern within their active zone. The adjusted metrics provide a robust quantitative foundation for understanding their physical output during the game, complemented by visual insights into their court presence and movement tendencies.\\n\"\"\"\n",

            "Qualitative Insights:\n",
            "Trajectory Analysis:\n",

            "  - Repetitive Patterns: There are instances of the player returning to a similar central position, suggesting a 'home base' or ready stance. The flow of movement appears fluid and continuous, indicating successful tracking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Activity Heatmap Analysis:\n",
            "  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\n",
            "  - Areas of Less Activity: Areas towards the top and right of the frame show considerably lower activity, suggesting these parts of the court are less frequently visited by the player.\n",
            "  - Court Coverage & Efficiency: The concentrated hotspot implies a focused court coverage, potentially indicating efficiency in covering their designated playing area or a strategic limitation to a specific zone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Impact of Perspective Adjustment:\n",
            "The perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated. This aids in a more accurate interpretation of the player's performance metrics.\n",
            "\n",
            "Summary:\n",
            "Based on these observations, the primary player demonstrates a focused and consistent movement pattern within their active zone. The adjusted metrics provide a robust quantitative foundation for understanding their physical output during the game, complemented by visual insights into their court presence and movement tendencies.\n",

            "Activity Heatmap Analysis:\n",
            "  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\n",

            "\n",
            "Impact of Perspective Adjustment:\n",
            "The perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated. This aids in a more accurate interpretation of the player's performance metrics.\n",

            "Qualitative Insights:\n",
            "Trajectory Analysis:\n",
            "  - Overall Path: The player's trajectory shows predominant movement in the lower-left quadrant of the court, with occasional shifts towards the center. Movements are generally confined to this specific area.\n",
            "  - Repetitive Patterns: There are instances of the player returning to a similar central position, suggesting a 'home base' or ready stance. The flow of movement appears fluid and continuous, indicating successful tracking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Activity Heatmap Analysis:\n",
            "  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\n",
            "  - Areas of Less Activity: Areas towards the top and right of the frame show considerably lower activity, suggesting these parts of the court are less frequently visited by the player.\n",
            "  - Court Coverage & Efficiency: The concentrated hotspot implies a focused court coverage, potentially indicating efficiency in covering their designated playing area or a strategic limitation to a specific zone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Impact of Perspective Adjustment:\n",
            "The perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated. This aids in a more accurate interpretation of the player's performance metrics.\n",
            "\n",
            "Summary:\n",
            "Based on these observations, the primary player demonstrates a focused and consistent movement pattern within their active zone. The adjusted metrics provide a robust quantitative foundation for understanding their physical output during the game, complemented by visual insights into their court presence and movement tendencies.\n",

            "Qualitative Insights:\n",
            "Trajectory Analysis:\n",
            "  - Overall Path: The player's trajectory shows predominant movement in the lower-left quadrant of the court, with occasional shifts towards the center. Movements are generally confined to this specific area.\n",
            "  - Repetitive Patterns: There are instances of the player returning to a similar central position, suggesting a 'home base' or ready stance. The flow of movement appears fluid and continuous, indicating successful tracking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Activity Heatmap Analysis:\n",
            "  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\n",
            "  - Areas of Less Activity: Areas towards the top and right of the frame show considerably lower activity, suggesting these parts of the court are less frequently visited by the player.\n",
            "  - Court Coverage & Efficiency: The concentrated hotspot implies a focused court coverage, potentially indicating efficiency in covering their designated playing area or a strategic limitation to a specific zone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Impact of Perspective Adjustment:\n",
            "The perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated. This aids in a more accurate interpretation of the player's performance metrics.\n",
            "\n",
            "Summary:\n",
            "Based on these observations, the primary player demonstrates a focused and consistent movement pattern within their active zone. The adjusted metrics provide a robust quantitative foundation for understanding their physical output during the game, complemented by visual insights into their court presence and movement tendencies.\n",

            "Activity Heatmap Analysis:\n",
            "  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\n",

            "\n",
            "Impact of Perspective Adjustment:\n",
            "The perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated.

        "The previous attempts to generate coherent coaching feedback using the `gpt2` model have consistently produced irrelevant and nonsensical output, demonstrating its limitations for this complex, domain-specific task. As per the overarching task's requirement to use a 'more capable LLM (e.g., Google Generative AI)', I will now proceed to install and set up the `google-generativeai` library and client. This will enable us to leverage a more powerful model to generate higher-quality feedback. I will also make sure all the required dataframes and variables are initialized by replicating the latest comprehensive data initialization step.\n",

            "Qualitative Insights:\n",
            "Trajectory Analysis:\n",
            "  - Overall Path: The player's trajectory shows predominant movement in the lower-left quadrant of the court, with occasional shifts towards the center. Movements are generally confined to this specific area.\n",
            "  - Repetitive Patterns: There are instances of the player returning to a similar central position, suggesting a 'home base' or ready stance. The flow of movement appears fluid and continuous, indicating successful tracking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Activity Heatmap Analysis:\n",
            "  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\n",
            "  - Areas of Less Activity: Areas towards the top and right of the frame show considerably lower activity, suggesting these parts of the court are less frequently visited by the player.\n",
            "  - Court Coverage & Efficiency: The concentrated hotspot implies a focused court coverage, potentially indicating efficiency in covering their designated playing area or a strategic limitation to a specific zone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Impact of Perspective Adjustment:\n",
            "The perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated. This aids in a more accurate interpretation of the player's performance metrics.\n",
            "\n",
            "Summary:\n",
            "Based on these observations, the primary player demonstrates a focused and consistent movement pattern within their active zone. The adjusted metrics provide a robust quantitative foundation for understanding their physical output during the game, complemented by visual insights into their court presence and movement tendencies.\n",

Movements are generally confined to this specific area.\\n  - Repetitive Patterns: There are instances of the player returning to a similar central position, suggesting a 'home base' or ready stance. The flow of movement appears fluid and continuous, indicating successful tracking.\\n\\nActivity Heatmap Analysis:\\n  - Hotspots: A significant 'hotspot' is observed in the lower-left portion of the frame (approximately x=100-250, y=600-800 pixels). This indicates the player spends most of their time and performs the majority of their actions within this zone.\\n  - Areas of Less Activity: Areas towards the top and right of the frame show considerably lower activity, suggesting these parts of the court are less frequently visited by the player.\\n  - Court Coverage & Efficiency: The concentrated hotspot implies a focused court coverage, potentially indicating efficiency in covering their designated playing area or a strategic limitation to a specific zone.\\n\\nImpact of Perspective Adjustment:\\nThe perspective adjustment ensures that movements appearing further away (higher in the frame) are weighted more heavily, providing a more realistic estimation of actual movement extent on the court and preventing close-up movements from being exaggerated. This aids in a more accurate interpretation of the player's performance metrics.\\n\\nSummary:\\nBased on these observations, the primary player demonstrates a focused and consistent movement pattern within their active zone. The adjusted metrics provide a robust quantitative foundation for understanding their physical output during the game, complemented by visual insights into their court presence and movement tendencies.\\n\"\"\"\n",
